  My name is Mavi Zabala, a 21 year old student currently majoring in Multimedia arts. In my past time, I learn Japanese and French, read books, dance and many others. Books that I have been interested with for the longest time are those that tackle World War II topics-- may it be fictituous or otherwise. With that said, here is my portfolio of some of the works I have done throughout the years. Hope you enjoy!
